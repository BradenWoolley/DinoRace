# DinoRace
DinoRace is a 3D mobile game made in Unity3d with C#.
In the game the player controls a gunner on the back of a small truck speeding away from dinosaurs.
The game will feature two modes, an AR wave survivor and a infinite runner.
NB - The inifinte runner is in development as complications during the AR prototype have forced a redesign of its mechanics.
